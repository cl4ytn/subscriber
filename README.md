1. What is amqp?
Advanced Message Queuing Protocol (AMQP) is a protocol for facilitating communication between applications or services. In other words, it provides a way for software components to communicate asynchronously. This promotes decoupling and scalability in distributed systems. AMQP has a set of rules that allow messages to be exchanged across different platforms and programming languages. It supports features such as message queuing, routing, and delivery assurance, enabling robust and fault-tolerant messaging architectures.
